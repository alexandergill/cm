# cm
manage a cad project

cm is a python tool for managing cad projects. It keeps track of all the files and parts in a project, and which files belong to which parts.

The main advantage of using cm is that it lets you work with filenames that tell you what a file is, such as `drive-shaft.par`, and then build your project into files named by their part numbers, like `af21.par`. This format is preferred by manufacturers, but is difficult to work with.

cm also allows you to automatically generate bills of materials.
